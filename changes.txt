added asserts on the type of VoreData to appease the linter
added different vore loci; "O" == Oral, "A" == Anal, and "U" == Unbirth; this is stored in VoreData as the value of VoreData[character].Prey, which was previously unused.
	VoreData[character].Digestion is now a table with keys "O", "A", and "U", and the value of each is the digestion state of each locus.
	The word "Locus/Loci" is used since it it not likely to be used elsewhere, and captures the intent of the feature. Single letters are used to make parsing data easier
changed 'swallowType' to 'digestionType', and added 'voreType' in swallow functions to account for this change
moved SP_FullySwallow to VoreUtils and made moved its calls to be inside of SP_SwallowPrey - this should be much neater, and allows us to more concisely pass down params
Changed "SP_Target_Vore" (and its children) to "SP_Target_Swallow"
Vore spells now have a strict naming convention. The convention is "SP_" + SpellType + "_" + the effect of the spell (Swallow_Endo, Swallow_Lethal, Bellyport, etc) + "_" + the first letter of the voreType.
	An example would be "SP_Target_Swallow_Lethal_O". This change was made to allow us to pattern match the spells, which is way cleaner then grabbing substrings
started splitting up the stat sheets as they've gotten bloated- any core swallowing spells are now in Vore_Core_Spell, any core regurgitation spells are in Vore_Core_Regurgitate,
	any core fundamental statuses (unless tied to a potion) are in Vore_Core_Status
